Hi,
I just try now over several hours to change the name of the avatar from "anonymous" to an other name.
I tried it in the Brave-Browser and also in the Firefox-Browser. My MetaMask-Wallet is connected.
I also already retried the process several times. Do someone has an idea?

It is just appearing:

"Querying Blockchain..." and 
"Registering..."

But nothing happend.
Or can it be that it takes several hours?
